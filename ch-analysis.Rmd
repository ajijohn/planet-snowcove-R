```{r , echo=FALSE}
start_time <- Sys.time()
  beginCluster()
  
```

```{r cars}
ch_norm <- raster('./data/switzerland_dem_clipped_wgs84_3mnormalized_layers_r2.tiff')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
